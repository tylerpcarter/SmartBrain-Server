4. You must add your own API key to .env_EDIT_THIS_FILE. Note once you've pasted your API key where YOUR-API-KEY-HERE is, you'll need to rename the file to ".env" (NOT ".env_EDIT_THIS_FILE).
5. Add your own database credentials to `server.js`. Add credentials properly, including overwriting "connection" on line 13.
6. Run `npm start`
